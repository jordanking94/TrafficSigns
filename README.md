# TrafficSigns
MPE Thesis Project: CNN-based Traffic Sign Recognition with Detection

Use TensorFlow binary from 
https://github.com/PINTO0309/Tensorflow-bin
in order to ensure that the TF Lite module is functional on the Raspberry Pi. 

Code has been written for OpenCV3 and Tensorflow 2. 

I have not included the code for training that was used due to availability. I highly recommend using Keras! :)
